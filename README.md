## Points of Interest
The following points of interest have already been gathered. Included data sets are shipped with the geoJSON file in this repository. Data sets that are not included have been omitted from the geoJSON file, but are mentioned here in case a candidate POI is close to a HUC12 pour point, in which case it may not need to be added to the POI list.

POI data sources:

- Canadian Streamgages in the domain (included)
